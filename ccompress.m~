function y = ccompress(x,N,varargin)
% Y = ccompress(X,N) takes an array X and downsamples it by a
% factor N along each of the first 3 dimensions. 
% The default kernel is Gaussian with standard deviation N/2 and width 
% 2*N + 1 
% The array returned is single-precision.
% Y = ccompress(X,N,I1...In) compresses an n-dimensional array along
% indices given by I1...In. For this function, I1...In must be vectors of
% indices, all of equal length. Be careful about how you use this feature.

% If h(N) is gaussian with variance S2 and width W, then conv(h(N),h(N)) is
% gaussian with variance 2*S2 and width 2*W - 1.
% Require S2 = (cN)^2. Then 2*S2 = 2*c^2*N^2, and for h(2N) variance is
% (2cN)^2, so we want 2*c^2*N^2 = 4*c^2*N^2, which is not possible. 
% If S2 = c*N, then we have what we want. But this requires std =
